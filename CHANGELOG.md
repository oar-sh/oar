## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-02

### Changed

- **The project is now OAR — Open Agent Relay** (`@oar-sh/oar`, binary `oar`,
  home at [oar.sh](https://oar.sh)). It began life as `copilot-remote` and has
  long outgrown the name: one relay now drives Copilot (CLI extension or SDK
  engine), Claude (Agent SDK), Cursor, Grok, and OpenAI BYOK.
- Global installs keep their state in `~/.oar` (`%APPDATA%\oar` on Windows) so
  `npm i -g` updates can never touch the database. Existing state from a git
  checkout or the legacy managed config dir is migrated in once, copy-never-move,
  with WAL checkpointing and integrity verification; the old tree is left behind
  as the rollback path. Git checkouts keep their repo-local layout unchanged.
- The published npm package now contains only the runtime (an explicit `files`
  allowlist); tests, docs, and screenshots stay in the repo.

### Added

- `oar --migrate-from <old-checkout>` imports relay state from a pre-rename
  checkout into `~/.oar`.
